# Guide

## General
1) STAY CALM
2) Use paper (during theory AND implementation)
3) do NOT waste time
    - Don't just sit there
    - Take a 5 minute break if needed
    
## Implementation

1) Look for edge cases
     - n = 1 ?
2) Use paper
3) Shorter code is better code
4) If TL is a problem, don't use STL
